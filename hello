hello
Let's Start implementation:
Here's a breakdown of the steps to implement the described Azure architecture:
**1. Deploying VMs in Central US and West US:**
- **Create Resource Group:** Create Singel resource group for both regions.
- **Create Virtual Networks (VNets):** In each region, create a VNet with appropriate subnets for VMs and Application Gateway.
- **Deploy VMs:**
    - Use portal to deploy two Linux VMs (VM1 and VM2) in each region within their respective VNets.
    - Choose a suitable VM size based on your resource requirements.
    - Ensure SSH access is configured for later access.
**2. Configuring Storage Account:**
- Create a single storage account in one of the regions (e.g., Central US).
- Within the storage account, create containers:
    - `error`: This will host the `error.html` file for displaying error pages.
**3. Uploading error.html and Configuring Application Gateway:**
- Upload the `error.html` file from the GitHub repository to the `error` container in your storage account.
- Deploy an Application Gateway in each region within its respective VNet.
- Configure Application Gateway rules:
    - Rule 1: Route traffic to VM2 (home page) for the root domain (`example.com`).
    - Rule 2: Route traffic to VM1 (upload page) for the `/upload` path (`example.com/upload`).
    - Configure Application Gateway to serve the `error.html` file from the storage account for 403 and 502 errors.
**4. Deploying Code and Running Scripts:**
- Clone the GitHub repository (`https://github.com/azcloudberg/azproject`) onto both VM1 and VM2 in each region.
- Run the appropriate script on each VM:
    - VM1: `./vm1.sh` (deploys the upload page)
    - VM2: `./vm2.sh` (deploys the home page)
- Edit the `config.py` file on VM1 and enter the storage account details for uploading files.
- Run `sudo python3 app.py` on VM1 to start the upload functionality.
**5. Configuring Traffic Manager:**
- Create a Traffic Manager profile in the Azure portal.
- Configure the profile to use the "Performance" routing method for optimal traffic distribution.
- Add the public IP addresses of the Application Gateways in both regions as endpoints to the Traffic Manager profile.
- Point your custom domain name (`example.com`) to the Traffic Manager profile's DNS name.
