# Deploying Web-pages on Virtual Machines

## There are three web pages to be deployed:
1. The home page is the default page (VM2)
2. The upload page is where you can upload the files to your Azure Blob Storage (VM1)
3. The error page for 403 and 502 errors
#### Application Gateway has to be configured in the following manner:
1. Example.com should be pointed to the home page
2. Example.com/upload should be pointed to the upload page
3. Application Gatewayâ€™s error pages should be pointed to error.html which should be hosted as a static website in Azure Containers. The error.html file is present in the GitHub repository

Azure VMs (Virtual Machines) are a fundamental service offered by Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing platform. 

#### What are Azure VMs?

Virtual machines are essentially virtual computers hosted on Microsoft's powerful physical servers.
They provide a dedicated computing environment within the Azure cloud, offering the flexibility of a physical machine without the need to manage the underlying hardware.
Each VM comes with its own CPU, memory, storage, and operating system, allowing you to install and run applications just like on a physical computer.

#### Key Features of Azure VMs:

1.Scalability: Easily scale your resources up or down based on your needs. Add or remove VMs as your workload fluctuates.

2.Cost-Effectiveness: Pay only for the resources you use, optimizing costs compared to maintaining physical servers.

3.High Availability: Azure offers various options for ensuring high availability of your VMs, minimizing downtime.

4.Security: Benefit from Microsoft's robust security infrastructure and features to protect your VMs and data.

5.Wide Range of Operating Systems: Choose from a vast selection of Windows and Linux distributions to suit your specific needs.

6.Integration with Azure Services: Seamlessly integrate your VMs with other Azure services like databases, storage solutions, and networking tools.
#### Common Use Cases for Azure VMs:
1.Development and Testing: Create isolated environments for developing and testing applications without impacting production systems.

2.Hosting Web Applications: Deploy and run web applications on scalable and secure VMs.

3.Running Business-Critical Applications: Migrate existing business applications to the cloud for enhanced performance and reliability.

4.Disaster Recovery: Set up VMs for disaster recovery purposes, ensuring business continuity in case of outages.


#### Azure Application Gateway 
Is a powerful web traffic load balancer operating at the application layer (layer 7) within the Azure cloud platform. Here's a breakdown of its key features and functionalities:

#### What it does:

1.Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers in your web application infrastructure, ensuring high availability and scalability.

2.Application Layer Routing: Makes routing decisions based on various factors like URL path, host header, or other HTTP(S) request attributes. This allows you to direct specific traffic to the most appropriate backend servers.

3.SSL/TLS Termination: Offloads the encryption and decryption process from your backend servers, improving performance and security.

4.Web Application Firewall (WAF): Provides basic protection against common web attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

#### Common Use Cases Application Gateway:

1.Distributing traffic across multiple web servers: Ensure optimal performance and prevent overloading individual servers.

2.Routing traffic based on specific criteria: Direct users to different backend servers based on their requests.

3.Securing web applications: Mitigate common web attacks with the built-in WAF.

4.Offloading SSL/TLS termination: Improve backend server performance and simplify certificate management.

#### Azure Traffic Manager 
Is a DNS-based traffic load balancer offered by Microsoft Azure. It plays a crucial role in managing and optimizing traffic flow within your applications. Here's a breakdown of its key features and functionalities:

#### What it does:

1.Traffic Routing: Directs user traffic to the most appropriate service endpoint based on various pre-defined routing methods. This can be based on factors like:

- Priority: Route traffic to the highest priority endpoint.
- Performance: Route traffic to the endpoint with the fastest response times.
- Geographic: Route traffic to the endpoint closest to the user's location.
- Weighted Round Robin: Distribute traffic evenly across multiple endpoints based on weight assignments.
- Subnet: Route traffic based on the user's IP address subnet.
- Multi-value: Return multiple healthy endpoints in the DNS response for further client-side selection.
2.Health Monitoring: Continuously monitors the health of your service endpoints, automatically detecting and responding to failures.

3.High Availability: Ensures uninterrupted service by directing traffic away from unhealthy endpoints to healthy ones.

4.Global Reach: Supports distributing traffic across multiple Azure regions and even external endpoints outside Azure.

#### Key Benefits:

1.Improved Application Performance: Ensures users are directed to the most responsive and geographically closest endpoint.

2.Reduced Downtime: Automatic failover to healthy endpoints minimizes service disruptions.

3.Scalability: Easily scales your application infrastructure by adding or removing endpoints as needed.

4>Simplified Management: Provides a centralized interface for configuring traffic routing and monitoring endpoints.

#### Common Use Cases Azure Traffic Manager:

1>Distributing traffic across geographically dispersed web servers: Improve user experience by reducing latency.

2>Ensuring high availability for critical applications: Minimize downtime and maintain service continuity.

3>Implementing disaster recovery strategies: Route traffic away from failing regions to ensure business continuity.

4>Balancing traffic across multiple cloud services: Optimize resource utilization and prevent overloading individual services.
